To understand the difference between a router and a switch, it's helpful to think about their primary functions and the "layers" of network communication they operate within. Here's a breakdown:

Switches:

Function:
Switches primarily connect devices within the same local area network (LAN). They facilitate communication between devices like computers, printers, and servers that are all within the same network.   
They operate at Layer 2 (the Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.   
They use MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to forward data.   
How they work:
A switch maintains a table of MAC addresses, learning which devices are connected to each of its ports.   
When a device sends data, the switch examines the destination MAC address and forwards the data only to the port where that device is located. This makes communication efficient.   
Switches create collision domains on each port, and a single broadcast domain by default.   
In simple terms:
A switch is like a traffic cop within a single neighborhood, directing traffic between houses on the same street.   
Routers:

Function:
Routers connect different networks together. This can include connecting your home network to the internet or connecting different LANs within a large organization.   
They operate at Layer 3 (the Network Layer) of the OSI model.   
They use IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to route data.   
How they work:
A router maintains a routing table that contains information about different networks and the best paths to reach them.   
When data needs to be sent from one network to another, the router examines the destination IP address and forwards the data along the optimal path.   
Routers create broadcast domain boundries.   
In simple terms:
A router is like a postal service, directing mail between different cities or countries.   
Key Differences Summarized:

Layer of Operation:
Switch: Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
Router: Layer 3 (Network Layer)
Addresses Used:
Switch: MAC addresses
Router: IP addresses

Network Scope:
Switch: Within a LAN
Router: Between different networks (LANs, WANs)
Primary Purpose:
Switch: Connects devices within a network.   
Router: Connects networks together.   
Essentially, switches handle local traffic, while routers handle traffic between networks.
