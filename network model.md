Let's break down the hierarchical networking model from smallest scale to largest scale, explaining where and when it's used and the technologies involved at each level.

1️⃣ Personal Area Network (PAN)
🔹 What is it?
A Personal Area Network (PAN) connects a few personal devices within a small range (a few meters).

🔹 Where is it used?

Your home, car, or body-worn devices.
Example: Bluetooth, smart home devices, wearable tech (smartwatch, fitness trackers).
🔹 Technologies Used

Bluetooth (short-range wireless communication).
WiFi (connecting mobile to home internet).
USB, Infrared, NFC (for data transfer).
2️⃣ Local Area Network (LAN)
🔹 What is it?
A LAN connects multiple devices within a building or small geographical area. It allows communication between computers, printers, and other networked devices.

🔹 Where is it used?

Home Networks (connecting PCs, smart TVs, IoT devices).
Offices, Schools, Colleges (WiFi & wired networks for internal use).
🔹 Technologies Used

Ethernet (wired connection using switches & routers).
WiFi (wireless LAN access).
Routers, Switches, Hubs, Access Points (APs).
🔹 Key Concepts in LAN

VLAN (Virtual LAN): Used in big offices to separate networks logically (HR, IT, Security).
Collision & Broadcast Domains: Important for controlling network congestion.
3️⃣ Campus Area Network (CAN)
🔹 What is it?
A CAN connects multiple LANs within a university, hospital, or corporate campus.

🔹 Where is it used?

Universities, Business Parks, Government Campuses.
Multiple buildings connected with fiber optics & high-speed networks.
🔹 Technologies Used

Fiber Optic cables (for high-speed connectivity).
Enterprise WiFi Networks (for campus-wide access).
Data Centers, DNS Servers, Internal VPNs.
4️⃣ Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
🔹 What is it?
A MAN connects multiple LANs or CANs within a city or metropolitan region.

🔹 Where is it used?

City-wide services (public WiFi, traffic monitoring, smart cities).
Colleges & Offices with multiple branches across a city.
🔹 Technologies Used

Fiber-Optic Backbone, 5G, Microwave Links.
ISPs & Data Centers for Cloud Hosting.
🔹 Example:

Smart City Networks: Traffic signals, surveillance cameras, and government offices connected via fiber optics.
5️⃣ Wide Area Network (WAN)
🔹 What is it?
A WAN connects cities, states, or countries. It covers a vast area and requires ISPs to manage traffic between different locations.

🔹 Where is it used?

Multi-national corporations with global offices.
Government agencies handling large-scale networks.
🔹 Technologies Used

MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) for fast routing.
Satellite, Fiber Optics, Submarine Cables.
🔹 Example:

A bank with branches across India needs WAN to connect its ATMs, offices, and customer databases.
6️⃣ Global Internet Infrastructure
🔹 What is it?
This is the largest-scale network that connects everything globally. It consists of:

Undersea cables, Satellites, Cloud Computing, and ISPs.
🔹 Where is it used?

Everything connected to the internet.
Websites, online banking, video streaming, global communications.
🔹 Technologies Used

Data Centers & Cloud Providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure).
Content Delivery Networks (CDN) to speed up web services.
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for global routing.
🔹 Example:

When you access Google.com, your request travels through multiple ISPs, DNS servers, and data centers across the world.
🌍 Networking Technologies at Different Locations
