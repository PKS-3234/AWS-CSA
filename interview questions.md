16. MSS/MTU Explain.

17. As MSS was explained in TCP 3 way handshake, explain what is MTU and compare and contrast MSS and MTU together.

18. Why would you choose HTTPS over HTTP? From a technical perspective, what is

19. HTTPS?

20. Port number of HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DHCP ?

21. What is FTP? what kind of application it used for?

34. What is the difference between example.com and example.org?

35. Trouble shoot slow website.

36. How to view network stats?

37. What does NetStat do? Which Linux command finds routing tables?

38. Command to track and print the path traversed between different routers.

39. What command checks for open ports?

40. What command checks the routing table in Linux?

41. How to setup remote desktop connection using command line in windows

42. A scenario question about packet flow in NAT

43. How do you find out what your IP Address is?

44. What protocol is used and how it is used to gate out from private network.(ARP)?

45. Given the following information: 10.0.0.0/8 100,000 hosts on network There is a host with an IP of 10.0.0.1 who cannot connect, why is this? Also, a lot of hosts on the network are reporting that they cannot connect, why is this?

46. Suppose I have a brand new laptop and I wish to connect it to the internet. What should I do, and what shall happen in background before the laptop is connected to the internet? (Ans. Manually assigning IP address or DHCP and DORA procedure. They expect you to explain in depth about DHCP and DORA)

47. What exactly are the requirements to make two computers communicate (they are close to each other, connected to same network) (here, also highlight the fact that how one computer will uniquely identify the other computer)

48. Concept of public and private IPs? Can two systems connected to same network have the same public IPs? How conflict is resolved in that case?

49. Will I able to access amazon.com if I'm using private IP (say, if I'm a part of an organization). Or will I need a public IP as well to connect with it?

50. If one person is able to access amazon.com website, while the other person is not, what can be the possible valid reasons for the 2nd person, provided the amazon.com website is working fine. Why clearing cookies also helps in reaching to a website?
